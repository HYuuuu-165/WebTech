        <p>Hello there, welcome to this info page for the golf quiz. If you are here, I guess you are not
            families with this sport (or maybe you just clicked on the link for fun?). Whatever what
            brings you here, this simple information below give you a rough idea what this sport is, enjoy!</p>
        <p>Golf is a club-and-ball sport in which players use various clubs to hit balls into a series of holes on a course in as few strokes as possible.
            Golf, unlike most ball games, cannot and does not utilize a standardized playing area, and coping with the varied terrains encountered on different
            courses is a key part of the game. The game at the usual level is played on a course with an arranged progression of 18 holes, though recreational
            courses can be smaller, often having nine holes. Each hole on the course must contain a teeing ground to start from, and a putting green containing
            the actual hole or cup 4.25 inches (11 cm) in diameter. There are other standard forms of terrain in between, such as the fairway, rough (long grass),
            bunkers (or "sand traps"), and various hazards (water, rocks) but each hole on a course is unique in its specific layout and arrangement.

            Golf is played for the lowest number of strokes by an individual, known as stroke play, or the lowest score on the most individual holes in a complete
            round by an individual or team, known as match play. Stroke play is the most commonly seen format at all levels, but most especially at the elite level.

            The modern game of golf originated in 15th century Scotland. The 18-hole round was created at the Old Course at St Andrews in 1764. Golf's first major,
            and the world's oldest tournament in existence, is The Open Championship, also known as the British Open, which was first played in 1860 at the Prestwick
            Golf Club in Ayrshire, Scotland. This is one of the four major championships in men's professional golf, the other three being played in the
            United States: The Masters, the U.S. Open, and the PGA Championship.</p>
