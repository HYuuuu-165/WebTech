        <p>Hello there, welcome to this info page for the golf quiz. If you are here, I guess you are not
            families with this sport (or maybe you just clicked on the link for fun?). Whatever what
            brings you here, this simple information below give you a rough idea what this sport is, enjoy!</p>
        <p>Golf, is an outdoor sport. Individual or team players hole a small ball with a golf club,
            and the player with the fewest strokes wins. Most tournaments have nine or eighteen holes.
            At present, the more well-known individual competitions in the world are: British Open, British Amateur Golf Championship,
            U.S. Open, U.S. Amateur Golf Championship, American Masters, PGA Championship. The most famous team competitions are the Golf World Cup,
            the Ryder Cup Europe-America Tournament and the Walker Cup US-UK-Ireland Series. Golf will be re-listed as an
            Olympic sport at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics. The British Open, the US Open, the US Masters, and the PGA Championship
            are the four major championships in golf. It is generally believed that modern golf originated in Scotland in 1456,
            and today's 18-hole golf system is also formulated by Scotland. There is also the oldest golf club in the world, which is regarded
            as the quintessence of Scotland. Alan Shepard was the first person to play golf outside Earth, hauling a club and two balls aboard
            during the Apollo 14 mission. Although the first ball was missed, the second ball is said to have hit 2 miles in low drag and
            gravity conditions, the unofficial record for the longest tee shot.
